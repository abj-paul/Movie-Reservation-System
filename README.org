    - memset() and why its necesssary to initialize buffers.
* How it works.
It has 3 modes.
** Admin Mode
   Admin can add, delete or edit Movies to be premiered in the cinema hall. The information is stored so that it can be loaded anytime.
** User Mode
   Users can book or cancel tickets, see their ticket list and movies to be premiered. They can choose to pay online or locally. The information is stored as well as a separate file for each user.
** Moderator Mode
   The moderator can look up the information for any user given their username and cancel a ticket if the user decides to do so or he/she does not pay in time. He can also notify them. The changes are updated in the respective user's ticket-list file.
